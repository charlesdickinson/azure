Good morning Syndicasian!

This is an instruction document to connect into AQUANET communications with Azure.
Do you not have Azure? You should get it. It has the encryption module and allows you to encrypt/decrypt passwords.

To connect to AQUANET you must have the VPN client.
1)	Install it with $sudo apt-get install network-manager-vpnc
2)	Go to Configure VPNs and add a Cisco compatible VPN
3)	You need to make 4 AQUANET connections. Name them as follows and give them the following gateway IP:
		AQUANET-1	10.0.1.13	Centuriones
		AQUANET-2	10.0.1.10	Haxstreet
		AQUANET-3	10.0.1.11	Kairos
		AQUANET-4	10.0.1.12	Shell
4)	For each VPN, give them the group name remotes. The group password is in your keychain in Azure and is cnvpn, haxvpn etc
5)	Your username is your callsign and your password is in your keychain under vpn

Once connected to AQUANET you should connect to Mumble. Mumble is great.
1)	Open Mumble. You can press the button or type $mumble
2)	Hit Connect or press the little globe to add a server
3)	The AQUANET Mumble server is chat.aqua.ace or 192.169.0.16 and the password, when it asks for it, is in your keychain

As well, when connected to AQUANET, you should get on IRC.
1)	Open Xchat. Press the button or type $xchat
2)	In the Server List at the top, add a server.
3)	The servername for secure IRC is irc.aqua.ace with default port
4)	Join a channel by typing /join #channel
5)	Awesome channels are: #syn_hq, #syn_intel, #syn_isr, #syn_white_cell
6)	If you want to make an empty channel just type /join <thatchannel>
7)	To see a list of channels, type /channel

To get at shared files, use the AQUANET SFTP server.
1)	Open Azure > Services > FTP. This will open a pretty file browser.
or
1)	Type $sftp name@ftp.aqua.ace
2)	Fill out your credentials from the keychain. The service is called baffle

CONTINGENCIES

If you get disconnected from AQUANET:
1)	Try to reconnect
2)	See if your podmates can connect. If they can then contact a NETCON dude through them.
3)	If none of you can connect, try connecting to the next AQUANET.
4)	Wait in the next AQUANET (AQUANET-2 first) for 5 minutes. If joined by other people, everyone happy.
5)	If nobody joins the network, try AQUANET-1 then AQUANET-3.
6)	Try all the AQUANET and bunch together in Mumble where you find people.

If nobody is able to access AQUANET:
1)	Netcon will move Mumble to a public server.
2)	To connect, try accessing 192.168.24.16 then 192.168.40.16 then 192.168.48.16 then 192.168.36.16
3)	If there are no Mumble servers up on any of these services, Charlie will put one up on his laptop. Try 10.0.1.76 first, then Zenmap 10.0.1.* for something on port 64738.
4)	Access a public IRC server. This will be on 192.168.24.15 or 192.168.40.15 or 192.168.36.15. Default channel is #syndicasia
5)	If on a public IRC server, assume everything you are saying is being eavesdropped. Use codenames, figure out who is speaking, be a massive arsehole with suspicion

If you have no network connectivity at all:
1)	Keep an eye on WiFi. I shall attempt to create an adhoc network to you through the shoulder mounted device.
2)	Stay strong. We shall find you.
